## Libraries and Dependencies
The following Python libraries are required to run WikiWebCrawler:

- `urllib.request`: For making HTTP requests to Wikipedia pages.
- `re`: For regular expression operations, used in parsing HTML content.
- `time`: For adding delays between requests to prevent being blocked by Wikipedia's server.

## Installation
